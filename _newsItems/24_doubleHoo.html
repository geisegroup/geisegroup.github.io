text: Graduate students Caroline Morin and Charlie Leroux pitched collaborative undergraduate research projects via the UVA Office of Citizen Scholar Development's Double Hoo program. Their projects, titled <em>Evaluating an Electrolyzer for Selective and Resilient Lithium Hydroxide Production</em> and <em>Developing Selective Membranes for Non-Aqueous Electrochemical Flow Cells</em>, respectively, were selected by the UVA Office of Citizen Scholar Development to be supported during the Summer 2025 term. The Geise Research Group looks forward to welcoming summer students into the group to conduct research on these projects.
