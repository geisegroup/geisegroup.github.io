title: McCormack Publishes Thermodynamic Description of Cross-Over in Non-Aqueous Redox Flow Battery Membranes
text: Graduate research assistant Patrick McCormack (along with co-advisor Prof. Gary Koenig) published <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c14845" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thermodynamic interactions as a descriptor of cross-over in nonaqueous redox flow battery membranes</a> in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces. This paper reports the use of regular solution theory to describe thermodynamic interactions that influence membrane cross-over of organic redox active molecules in non-aqueous redox flow batteries.
