<br>
The American-Made Geothermal Lithium Extraction Prize is designed to find solutions that de-risk and increase market viability for direct lithium extraction (DLE) from geothermal brines. Advancement of DLE technologies allows for improved methods that lower cost, lessen environmental impact, and further the mission to turn the threat of climate change into an opportunity to revitalize the U.S. energy and critical materials supply chain. The American-Made Geothermal Lithium Extraction Prize is directed and administered by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/geothermal-technologies-office" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geothermal Technologies Office</a>.
