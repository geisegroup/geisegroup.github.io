title: Bannon Publishes in the Journal of Membrane Science
text: Graduate research assistant Sean Bannon published <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2023.122396" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Influence of Donnan and dielectric exclusion on ion sorption in sulfonated polysulfones</a> has been accepted for publication in the Journal of Membrane Science. This paper reports a strategy for combining Donnan exclusion, Manning counter-ion condensation, and dielectric exclusion theory to describe ion sorption in sulfonated polysulfone membranes.
