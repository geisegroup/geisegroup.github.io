title: Geise & Madsen Groups Publish on Local Water Transport in Rubbery versus Glassy Membranes
text: Geise Research Group alum Kevin Chang published research along with graduate student Drew Korovich and Prof. Lou Madsen at Virginia Tech. The paper, titled <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.1c01746" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Local Water Transport in Rubbery versus Glassy Separation Membranes and Analogous Solutions</a> was accepted for publication in Macromolecules. The paper describes local molecular motions that inform selective transport in rubbery versus glassy polymer membranes and helps to explain why glassy polymers often offer greater selectivity compared to rubbery polymers.
