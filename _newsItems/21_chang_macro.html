title: Geise & Madsen Groups Publish on Local Water Transport in Rubbery versus Glassy Membranes
text: Geise Research Group alum Dr. Kevin Chang published <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.1c01746" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Local Water Transport in Rubbery versus Glassy Separation Membranes and Analogous Solutions</a> in Macromolecules along with colleagues at Virginia Tech. The paper describes local molecular motions that inform selective transport in rubbery versus glassy polymer membranes and helps to explain why glassy polymers often offer greater selectivity compared to rubbery polymers.
